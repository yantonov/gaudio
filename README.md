## Gaudio

Chrome extension that helps you to extract links to audio files from the web page.

### Motivation
Many podcast sites don't provide direct links to the audio files.  
For example, you want to download the file and listen to it using a custom player or upload later to your mobile phone and listen there.  
This extension allows you to get a direct link to the audio file.

#### Status
This is a first draft, created only to check the concept and play with chrome extension api.  
The next possible steps:  
1. rewrite to clojurescript  
2. add style to the popup  
3. add settings about file extensions (predicates can be too much here)
