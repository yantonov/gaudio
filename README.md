## Gaudio

Chrome extension that helps you to extract links to audio files from the web page.

### Motivation
Many podcast sites don't provide direct links to the audio files.  
For example, you want to download the file and listen to it using a custom player or upload later to your mobile phone and listen there.  
This extension allows you to get a direct link to the audio file.

### How to install
1. Clone this repository to a local folder.
2. Open the Chrome extension page and turn on "Developer mode"
3. Select "Load Unpacked" (extension) and point it to the extension folder (1) - and you are done!
